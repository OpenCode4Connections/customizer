### 4. Take Part in the Connections Customizer Contest
To help jump start you with IBM Connections Customizer we are running a [community contest][7] for everyone to get involved. If you can write a cool IBM Connections customization and make it available to the community as an open sourced project then you could well be on your way to winning an ***iPad Mini*** courtesy of [OpenCode4Connections.org][5]. See these [videos][8] to help you on your way.
